   <h3> I am a teacher of six years and a life-long learner. Welcome to my website.</h3>

    <p>I am proud to be an English Language Arts and Publications teacher in the Mehlville School District located in Saint Louis, MO. When I’m not teaching 11-14-year-old students at Margaret Buerkle Middle School, I’m teaching my 1-year-old son and 3-year-old daughter how to share. In my fleeting free time I enjoy designing tabletop games for use in the classroom, photography, and editing videos/images.</p>
