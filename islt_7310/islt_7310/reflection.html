      <p class="first">I have learned so much in my short career as a teacher. My teaching philosophy has been shaped by my experiences as a teacher, and I have learned so much about where I’m going by reflecting on where I’ve been.<br>
            <p class="indent">My career started out with the classic first year teacher clash of expectations vs. reality: planning lessons and realizing where they went wrong while teaching them. Feedback is fast while in a room with 30 students, and teachers who listen to and adjust based on the feedback their students give will grow and become stronger teachers for it.</p>
           <p class="indent">I am still growing to become a better teacher. I hope I always have this drive to be better and do better. Looking forward, my goals for my teaching career are to develop free online tools for learning and reduce academic gaps between students as much as possible while making learning as fun as possible. I want to continue developing games for learning that coincide with standards my students are trying to reach. It’s one thing to simply teach the content, but it’s another thing to foster a love of learning.</p>
            <p class="indent">My teaching philosophy is much like design philosophy: people first. When you create something, you are creating it for a person. Growing up, I went through too many teachers that gave me a worksheet first and knew who I was second, and that is what I try to avoid. You must make sure the human being at a desk in front of you is doing okay, and that they are in your room to learn with you today. It’s easier when teaching elementary students to realize when one student is not in a headspace of learning that day, and to offer services and support. As secondary-level teachers we must remember that each child may only be with us for 45 minutes. That child has a wealth of experiences and emotions they are bringing to that 45-minute period. That isn’t much time to recognize, diagnose, and assist them in whatever struggles they brought that day. We must always support each child that enters the room, recognizing their humanity first, meeting their basic needs, and then sharing the knowledge we are passionate about with them.</p>

       <li class=past>Bachelor of Science in Middle School Language Arts Education from the University of Missouri-Columbia</li>

    <p>I am proud to be an English Language Arts and Publications teacher in the Mehlville School District located in Saint Louis, MO. When I’m not teaching 11-14-year-old students at Margaret Buerkle Middle School, I’m teaching my 1-year-old son and 3-year-old daughter how to share. In my fleeting free time I enjoy designing tabletop games for use in the classroom, photography, and editing videos/images.</p>
