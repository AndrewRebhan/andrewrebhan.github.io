  </div>
  <div class="item work1"><a name="teacher"></a>
      <h4 class="h4exp">Mehlville School District (Teacher)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Taught English Language Arts content to 7th grade students</li>
        <li>Made use of technology to facilitate project-based learning in various forms such as podcasts, videos, shared documents, screenplays, and more</li>
        <li>Assumed leadership positions through the PBIS committee, creating a digital student behavior/intervention tracker, and presenting teaching methods to peers</li>
    </ul>
<p class ="pexp">Teaching English Language Arts consists of a 90-minute block per class. 45 minutes are for reading instruction, and another 45 for writing instruction. I used spreadsheets to track reading and writing and help my students set goals for themselves. I am proud to say that my students have read over 100,000 pages this last year and collectively wrote nearly half a million words in one month while participating in National Novel Writing Month</p>
</div>
  <div class="item work2"><a name="substitute"></a>
  <h4 class="h4exp">Mehlville School District (Substitute Teaching)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Instructed students age 5-18 through substitute teaching</li>
        <li>Built relationships with students from various schools, age groups, classroom climates, and socioeconomic backgrounds</li>
        <li>Frequently requested by teachers to return to their classrooms</li>
    </ul>
<p class ="pexp">Substitute teaching helped me hone my classroom management skills across a wide range of age groups. Being a substitute teacher before being a full-time teacher also helped me sample a variety of lesson styles before being tasked with creating them for myself.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="item work3"><a name="volunteer"></a>
  <h4 class="h4exp">St. Trinity Summer School (Volunteer Teacher)</h4>
     <ul>
         <li>Ran math instruction for two summers for students from low socio-economic backgrounds and every elementary age group</li>
         <li>Used data to track student growth in math skills of 30+ students</li>
     </ul>
 <p class ="pexp">My experience at St. Trinity’s summer school was such a good jumping off point into my teaching career. The students kept me on my toes, and I learned so much about behavior management and instructional design in a matter of weeks. It was here that I learned why Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs is so important. I helped get each student fed and supported, and only then did I focus on instruction.</p>

   <h3> I am a teacher of six years and a life-long learner. Welcome to my website.</h3>
   <br>
   <h4>Education</h4>
   <ul class=education> 
       <li class=past>Bachelor of Science in Middle School Language Arts Education from the University of Missouri-Columbia</li>
       <li class=current>Currently enrolled in the Learning Technologies and Design Master’s Program at the University of Missouri-Columbia</li>
   </ul>
    <p>I am proud to be an English Language Arts and Publications teacher in the Mehlville School District located in Saint Louis, MO. When I’m not teaching 11-14-year-old students at Margaret Buerkle Middle School, I’m teaching my 1-year-old son and 3-year-old daughter how to share. In my fleeting free time I enjoy designing tabletop games for use in the classroom, photography, and editing videos/images.</p>
