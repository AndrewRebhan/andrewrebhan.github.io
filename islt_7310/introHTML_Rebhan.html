    <title>Welcome to Andrew Rebhan's Website</title>
</head>
<body>
My name is Andrew Rebhan, and I’m an ELA teacher from Saint Louis, Missouri. 

I don’t have any formal web design training, however I have collaborated in making websites with others before. I've developed some HTML skills over the years, but there are many more I need to fill in. Oh, and I can’t forget about the website I made in 6th grade about polar bears with the classic repeating grid of images as the site's background. Maybe some of that experience stuck with me. Hopefully the graphic design ideas did not.

In this course, I expect to become more self-sufficient in designing a website. I would like to use the skills I gain here to create a singular, user-friendly hub of resources for my students to use that covers topics found in my ELA and Publications classes.

My hobbies include designing tabletop games and playing games with my wife. We have two kids (a one-year-old and a three-year-old) so free time is scarce, but we enjoy what time we can find!
